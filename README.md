## Factory Location Problem & Vehicle Routing Problem
Repository containing two business analytics and optimization related projects, ordered in two folders:
* __Factory Location Problem__ (in: assignment-1-linear-programming): defining a mathematical problem for a Factory Location Problem and solving the Integer Linear Problem in Python using PuLP.
* __Vehicle Routing Problem__ (in: assignment-2-vrp): building an intial solution for a Vehicle Routing Problem using an insertion heuristic. Then, improving the solution using local search techniques (moves and swaps) and genetic algorithms.
