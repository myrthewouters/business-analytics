    "This class includes attributes and methods to generate a schedule (i.e., starting solution for VRP) through using a construction heuristic based on the Insertion Method.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The generation of a schedule through the RoutePlanner class is implemented in the following way:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with $j=1$\n",
    "1. Select the farthest unplanned store based on distance from headquarters and plan this store in a new route $r_j$ \n",
    "2. Sort all potential unplanned stores (i.e., of same type (Jumbo or Coop/other) as farthest store) in increasing distance from farthest store\n",
    "3. Try to plan each potential unplanned store $s_i$ at every position in route $r_j$. If there are feasible positions for $s_i$, insert $s_i$ at the best feasible position (i.e., the one that leads to the lowest total distance of route $r_j$). If there is no feasible positions for $s_i$, skip $s_i$ for route $r_j$\n",
    "4. As long as there are unplanned stores left to visit, $j=j+1$ and continue at step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1-3 for one iteration are implemented in the method `plan_route` and the iterative algorithm is implemented in the method `solve`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*There are a few important attributes, properties and methods of the RoutePlanner class to highlight:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* the `locations` attribute contains a list of all 133 locations to visit in the entire schedule\n",
    "* the `hq` attribute represents the headquarters\n",
    "* the `loc_distances_hq` property defines a sorted list of all locations in decreasing distance from headquarters\n",
    "* the `current_farthest_store` property defines an unplanned store $s$ that is farthest away from the headquarters at the start of iteration j\n",
    "* the `potential_stores` method defines potential stores to visit given a particular farthest store. Potential stores include unplanned stores with same store type as the farthest store\n",
    "* the `dist_farthest_store` method defines a sorted list of potential stores based on distance from farthest store\n",
    "* the `plan_route` method executes the construction heuristic for one iteration, i.e., defines one route\n",
    "* the `solve` method executes the entire construction heuristic and creates the schedule "
