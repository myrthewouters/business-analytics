    "## Factory Location Problem\n",
    "A company is transitioning into producing a product they formerly bought externally. To that end, it needs to decide where to build its factories. There are $N$ possible locations for a factory. Fixed costs (in EURO) per year for opening a factory at location $i$ are $F(i)$. Each factory can produce at most $C(i)$ kilograms of the product. The total demand per year (in kilograms) for each delivery address (DA) $j$ is $D(j)$. The transport costs (in EURO) for one kilogram between the factories and delivery addresses are $t(i,j)$.\n",
